# Decentral Events
## The problem Decentral Events solves
Currently, if a participant reserve for an event, then the event organizers have to pay for the food, and the space and also the seats are limited. And then if the participant doesn't show up then the resources are wasted.

So, we have built a platform where the participant can reserve for the event by staking some tokens and if he/she doesn't show for the event then the tokens will be transfered to the event organizers as compensation. Users can also cancel the reservation before the start time.

## TODOs
 - Currently only admin can mark attendance of the participants, but have also added a function in smart contract so that users can mark the presence of another users, and if a threshold is reached then the attendance will be marked authmatically.
